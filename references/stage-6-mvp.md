# Stage 6: MVP

## Goal
Combine proven PoCs into working product.

## Environment
Claude Code (✅ CODE ALLOWED)

## Input
- All completed PoCs
- PoC results documentation

## Process
1. MVP often emerges naturally from PoCs
2. Integrate proven components
3. Add remaining glue code
4. Comprehensive testing

## Output
- Working MVP
- Deployment documentation
- User documentation (if applicable)

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Core functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Matches north star vision
- [ ] Can be deployed/demonstrated

## Integration Approach

### Step 1: Inventory
List all completed PoCs and what they provide:
- PoC 1: [What it does]
- PoC 2: [What it does]
- etc.

### Step 2: Identify Gaps
What's missing between PoCs and MVP?
- Glue code needed
- UI/UX work
- Configuration
- Deployment

### Step 3: Integration Order
Plan the integration sequence:
1. Start with foundation PoCs
2. Layer on dependent PoCs
3. Add glue code
4. Final polish

### Step 4: Testing
- Integration tests (components work together)
- End-to-end tests (full user flows)
- Edge case handling

## MVP Definition

An MVP is:
- **Minimum**: Only essential features
- **Viable**: Actually solves the core problem
- **Product**: Can be used by real users

An MVP is NOT:
- A demo
- A prototype
- A proof of concept
- Feature-complete

## Quality Gates

Before declaring MVP complete:
- [ ] Core use case works end-to-end
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and critical edges
- [ ] Can explain how to use it
- [ ] Matches original north star vision

## Common Pitfalls
- Scope creep ("just one more feature")
- Ignoring technical debt from PoCs
- Skipping integration testing
- Not validating against north star

## What's Next After MVP?
- User feedback
- Iteration
- Scale considerations
- Feature expansion
