# dev-design

Structured workflow for taking ideas from concept to executable PoC plan.

**Philosophy**: dev-design handles the **design phase** (0 to 1). Once you have a PoC plan, hand off to the **dev-cycle skill** for the **development loop** (1 to N).

## Stage Overview

| Stage | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1. North Star | `docs/north-star.md` |
| 2. Architecture | `docs/[name]-architecture.md` |
| 3. Research | Market analysis, validation |
| 4. PoC Design | `docs/[name]-poc-design.md` |

**Note**: `[name]` can be anything - project name, feature name, module name, etc.

**Next**: → Hand off to `dev-cycle` skill for implementation

## ⛔ CRITICAL: NO-CODE SKILL

**All stages (1-4) are strictly NO-CODE zones.**

### What IS allowed:
- High-level architecture diagrams
- Data flow descriptions
- Workflow descriptions
- Concept explanations
- Pseudocode for complex logic (sparingly)
- API contract descriptions (endpoints, payloads)
- Technology stack decisions with rationale

### What is NOT allowed:
- Python/JavaScript/any implementation code
- Function definitions
- Class implementations
- Code snippets that could be copy-pasted
- "Here's how you'd implement this..." with actual code

### Why This Matters:
- Preserves token space for what matters: thinking and design
- Prevents premature implementation decisions
- Forces clear conceptual understanding before coding

### If Asked to Write Code:
Respond: "We're in the [North Star/Architecture/Research/PoC Design] stage — let's keep focus on [vision/architecture/validation/design]. Code comes later in the dev-cycle skill. For now, let me describe how this would work at a high level..."

## Stage 1: North Star

**Goal**: Refine the idea into a clear, feasible vision

**Input**: Idea (verbal, notes, rough sketch)

**Template**: `assets/templates/north-star.md`

**Process**:
1. Understand the core problem being solved
2. Define how it would work (high-level)
3. Identify key components and their relationships
4. Surface assumptions and unknowns

**Output**: `docs/north-star.md`

### Stage 1 Complete Checklist
- [ ] `docs/north-star.md` created using template
- [ ] Problem clearly stated
- [ ] Solution approach makes sense
- [ ] Technical feasibility seems reasonable
- [ ] No obvious blockers identified

**Next**: → Stage 2: Architecture

---

## Stage 2: Architecture

**Goal**: Create technical architecture and integration plan

**Input**: North Star doc (`docs/north-star.md`)

**Template**: `assets/templates/architecture.md`

**Naming**: `docs/[name]-architecture.md` where `[name]` is your project/feature/module name

**Process**:
1. Define system architecture
2. Identify technology stack
3. Map data flows
4. Design component interactions
5. Identify integration points

**Output**: `docs/[name]-architecture.md`

### Stage 2 Complete Checklist
- [ ] `docs/[name]-architecture.md` created using template
- [ ] Architecture diagram complete
- [ ] Tech stack justified
- [ ] Data flows documented
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] No code written (only diagrams and descriptions)
- [ ] Run `/verify-doc docs/[name]-architecture.md`

**Next**: → Stage 3: Research

---

## Stage 3: Research

**Goal**: Validate market fit and competitive landscape

**Input**: North Star doc (`docs/north-star.md`) and Architecture doc (`docs/[name]-architecture.md`)

**Process**:
1. Research competitors
2. Identify market gaps
3. Validate pricing assumptions
4. Assess technical differentiation
5. Multiple research passes to fine-tune

**Output**: Updates to `docs/north-star.md` and `docs/[name]-architecture.md`, market analysis

### Fast-Track Option

If research already exists (from prior sessions, reference docs, or external sources):
1. Review existing research docs for coverage
2. Verify all checklist items are addressed
3. Note source: "Research validated via [reference docs]"
4. Proceed to Stage 4

### Stage 3 Complete Checklist
- [ ] Competitors identified with strengths/weaknesses
- [ ] Market gap clearly articulated
- [ ] Differentiation strategy defined
- [ ] Pricing validated against market (if applicable)
- [ ] Go/no-go decision supported by evidence

**Next**: → Stage 4: PoC Design

---

## Stage 4: PoC Design

**Goal**: Define what needs to be proven and in what order — with PRODUCTION-GRADE thin slices

**Input**: Validated architecture doc (`docs/[name]-architecture.md`)

**Template**: `assets/templates/poc-design.md`

**Naming**: `docs/[name]-poc-design.md` where `[name]` matches your architecture doc prefix

**Process**:
1. Refine architecture with implementation perspective
2. Identify atomic things to prove (PoCs)
3. Map dependencies between PoCs
4. Create PoC diagram
5. Define success criteria for each PoC

**PoC Requirements**:

Each PoC must be:
- **Atomic**: Proves one specific thing (one capability/assumption, NOT one task - may include multiple related tasks)
- **Measurable**: Clear success criteria
- **🔒 Self-contained**: Works independently; doesn't break existing functionality and existing tests

**Golden Rule**: One feature = One PoC (minimize the number of PoCs; group related work)

**Output**: `docs/[name]-poc-design.md`

### Stage 4 Complete Checklist
- [ ] `docs/[name]-poc-design.md` created using template
- [ ] Each PoC proves one specific thing
- [ ] Dependencies mapped (which PoCs unlock others)
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Order of execution clear
- [ ] Run `/verify-doc docs/[name]-poc-design.md`

**Next**: → Hand off to **dev-cycle skill** for implementation

---

## Next: Hand Off to dev-cycle

Once you have `docs/[name]-poc-design.md` completed, hand off to the **dev-cycle** skill for implementation.

**dev-cycle** handles all development work through a repeating cycle: plan work items → execute step-by-step → test → repeat.
