## Milestones

### Milestone 1: [Name] (Core)
**Focus**: Core functionality that proves the product works
**Proves**: [What completing this milestone validates]
**Size**: [Expected PoC count: 10-20]
**Status**: Planning / In Progress / Complete

### Milestone 2: [Name] (if clear path visible)
**Focus**: [Theme - what this milestone achieves]
**Proves**: [What completing this milestone validates]
**Size**: [Expected PoC count: 10-20]
**Status**: Planning / In Progress / Complete

### Milestone 3: [Name] (if clear path visible)
**Focus**: [Theme]
**Proves**: [What completing this milestone validates]
**Size**: [Expected PoC count]
**Status**: Planning / In Progress / Complete

## Milestone Order

1. **[Milestone 1 Name]** (Core) - Core functionality (always first)
   - Why first: Proves the fundamental product works
   - Unlocks: All dependent milestones

2. **[Milestone 2 Name]** (if applicable)
   - Why second: [Rationale]
   - Depends on: Milestone 1
   - Unlocks: [What this enables]

3. **[Milestone 3 Name]** (if applicable)
   - Why third: [Rationale]
   - Depends on: Milestone 1, Milestone 2
   - Unlocks: [What this enables]

## Notes

**Organic Growth**: This document starts minimal (often just Milestone 1: Core) and grows as the project evolves and the path to the north star becomes clearer.

**Clear vs Unclear Path**:
- **Clear path**: If you can see the giant steps to reach the north star, plan 2-3 milestones upfront
- **Unclear path**: Start with just Milestone 1 (Core) - common with small/experimental projects
- Add more milestones as clarity emerges

**Dependencies**: [Any dependencies between milestones, risks, technical constraints]

**Risks**: [Risks that could impact milestone completion or order]
