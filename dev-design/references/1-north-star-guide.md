# Stage 1: North Star

## Goal
Refine the idea into a clear, feasible vision.

## Code Allowed
NO

## Timeline Estimates
NOT NEEDED - Focus on WHAT and WHY, not WHEN. Avoid timeline estimates (e.g., "Week 1-2", "2 weeks", "3 months"). Design phases don't need schedules.

## Input
- Idea (verbal, notes, rough sketch)

## Process
1. Understand the core problem being solved
2. Define how it would work (high-level)
3. Identify key components and their relationships
4. Surface assumptions and unknowns

## Output
`docs/[slug]-north-star.md` using `assets/templates/north-star.md`

Example: `docs/mc-north-star.md`

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Problem clearly stated
- [ ] Solution approach makes sense
- [ ] Technical feasibility seems reasonable
- [ ] No obvious blockers identified

## Key Questions to Answer
- What problem are we solving?
- For whom?
- Why now?
- What does success look like?
- What are the biggest unknowns?

## Common Pitfalls
- Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem
- Being too vague about the target user
- Ignoring technical constraints
- Scope creep at north star stage

## Next Stage
→ Stage 2: Architecture
