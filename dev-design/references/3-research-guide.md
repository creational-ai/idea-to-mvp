# Stage 3: Research

## Goal
Validate market fit and competitive landscape.

## Code Allowed
NO

## Input
- North Star doc (`docs/north-star.md`)
- Architecture doc (`docs/[name]-architecture.md`)

## Process
1. Research competitors
2. Identify market gaps
3. Validate pricing assumptions
4. Assess technical differentiation
5. Multiple research passes to fine-tune

## Output
- Updates to `docs/north-star.md` and `docs/[name]-architecture.md`
- Market analysis notes

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Competitors identified with strengths/weaknesses
- [ ] Market gap clearly articulated
- [ ] Differentiation strategy defined
- [ ] Pricing validated against market
- [ ] Go/no-go decision supported by evidence

## Research Areas

### Competitive Analysis
- Who else solves this problem?
- How do they solve it?
- What are their strengths/weaknesses?
- What's their pricing model?

### Market Validation
- Is this a real problem people pay to solve?
- How big is the potential market?
- What are users currently using?
- What would make them switch?

### Technical Differentiation
- What can we do that others can't?
- What's our unfair advantage?
- Are there technical barriers to entry?

### Pricing Research
- What do competitors charge?
- What value are we providing?
- What's the willingness to pay?

## Go/No-Go Decision
At the end of research, make a clear decision:
- **GO**: Evidence supports moving forward
- **PIVOT**: Adjust north-star/architecture based on findings
- **NO-GO**: Evidence suggests this won't work

## Common Pitfalls
- Confirmation bias (only finding supporting evidence)
- Ignoring competitive threats
- Overestimating market size
- Underestimating switching costs
