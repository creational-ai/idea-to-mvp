# [Feature/Issue] Overview

> **Purpose**: Plan how to address new features or issues discovered during implementation
>
> **Important**: Each injected PoC must be self-contained (works independently; doesn't break existing functionality and existing tests)

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: [What needs to be achieved]

**Strategy**: [High-level approach]

**Migration Approach**: [How to transition from current to target state]

**1. [Component/System 1]**
- [Current implementation details]
- [Dependencies]
- [Limitations]

**2. [Component/System 2]**
- [Current implementation details]
- [What it does]

**3. Current Dependencies**
```[language]
# [File/module]
[code example showing current implementation]
```

## Target Architecture

### Desired State

```
[High-level architecture diagram or description]
Component A
    ↓
Component B (NEW)
    ↓
    ├─→ Implementation 1
    └─→ Implementation 2
```

### Configuration-Based Behavior

```bash
# .env for Option 1
[config examples]

# .env for Option 2
[config examples]
```

## What Needs to Change

### 1. [Component/File 1] ([N] files)

#### `[file-path]`
**Current**: [What it does now]
```[language]
[current code]
```

**New**: [What it should do]
```[language]
[proposed code]

## PoC Breakdown

### Phase 1: [PoC N] - [Name]

**Prerequisites**:
- [Prerequisite 1]
- [Prerequisite 2]

**Implementation Steps**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Design Decision**: [Why this PoC is structured this way]

To keep PoC [N] self-contained and non-breaking:
- **Keep** [existing function/behavior] unchanged
- **Add** [new function/behavior] alongside
- **Why**: Ensures all existing [functionality] continues working without changes during PoC [N]
- **Migration path**: PoC [N+1] will refactor to use new implementation

```[language]
# [file] after PoC [N]
def existing_function():
    """Legacy function for existing code."""
    # Existing implementation unchanged

def new_function():
    """New function using improved approach."""
    # New implementation
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New functionality works independently

---

### Phase 2: [PoC N+1] - [Name]

**Depends on**: PoC [N]

**Steps**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] System works with either old or new implementation

### Phase 3: [PoC N+2] - [Name]

## Files Requiring Changes

| File | Change Type | Complexity | PoC |
|------|-------------|------------|-----|
| `[file-path]` | [Create/Modify/Refactor] | [Low/Medium/High] | PoC [N] |
| `[file-path]` | [Create/Modify/Refactor] | [Low/Medium/High] | PoC [N+1] |

**Total Estimated Effort**: [N] PoCs ([N], [N+1], [N+2])

## Next Steps

1. Review this overview and confirm approach
2. Update `[name]-poc-design.md` to incorporate PoCs [N], [N+1], [N+2] (if work involves PoCs)
3. Create implementation plan using 2-planning-guide.md
4. Implement and test
5. Proceed with next phases if Phase 1 succeeds
