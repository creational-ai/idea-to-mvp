## Usage

### dev-design

Start with an idea:

> "I have an idea for [description]. Let's design it."

Claude will guide you through the 5 stages, producing artifacts for each.

### market-research

After Stage 2 (or whenever you have enough context):

> "Do market research for [project-name]"

If you have Mission Control MCP connected, it will pull project data automatically.

**Output**: Market research report with Go/Pivot/Kill recommendation.

### business-validation

When you need to figure out the path to revenue:

> "How do I make money with [project]?"
> "What's blocking me from launching?"
> "Who would pay for this?"

Pulls full context from Mission Control (project → milestones → tasks), challenges assumptions, identifies real blockers.

**Output**: Business validation roadmap with PoC-based experiments and success criteria.

### framework-alignment

When you need strategic alignment analysis:

> "Framework alignment for [project]"
> "Are we building the right loops?"
> "What signals are we missing?"
> "How do we build a moat?"

Analyzes against Three Strategic Frameworks (Four Loops, Flywheel, Dangerous Intelligence). Identifies signal infrastructure gaps.

**Output**: Framework alignment doc with net inventory and implementation priorities.

## Philosophy: 200 Users First

Both skills follow the "200 users first" principle:

- **Production-grade quality** from day one
- **Right-sized** for first 200 paying users
- **No over-engineering** — scale milestone comes after PMF
- **Validate early** — market research before heavy investment

## Mission Control Integration

If you have the Mission Control MCP enabled, `market-research` will automatically pull project context:

```
get_project(slug) extracts:
├── objective          → Product vision
├── target_market      → Target customer
├── revenue_model      → Pricing strategy
├── monthly_cost       → Cost structure
├── projected_mrr      → Revenue targets
└── architecture_summary → Technical approach
```

## vs Claude Code Skills

## Development

### Editing in Claude Desktop → Repo

If you edited skills in Claude Desktop and exported new `.skill` files:

```bash
# 1. Export .skill files from Claude Desktop to releases/

# 2. Unpackage (single skill or all)
./unpackage.sh releases/my-skill.skill   # Single skill (new or update)
./unpackage.sh                            # All skills

# 3. Review changes
git status
```

### Editing in Repo → Claude Desktop

If you edited source folders directly:

```bash
# 1. Package source folders into .skill files
./package.sh

# 2. Import .skill files in Claude Desktop
#    Settings → Skills → Import Skill
```

### Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `package.sh` | Source folders → `.skill` files |
| `unpackage.sh [file]` | `.skill` files → Source folders (single or all) |
