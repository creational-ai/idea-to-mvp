# /dev-design

Create a design document for a task (Stage 1 of dev workflow).

## What This Does

Stage 1 of dev: Analyze a problem and design a solution WITHOUT writing code.

## Resources

**Read these for guidance**:
- `~/.claude/skills/dev/SKILL.md` - See "Stage 1: Design" section
- `~/.claude/skills/dev/references/1-design-guide.md` - Detailed process
- `~/.claude/skills/dev/assets/templates/1-design.md` - Design template

## Input

**First argument (recommended):**
- Source material: bug report, feature spec, rough notes, or existing design doc
- If omitted → create from scratch based on notes

**Other input modes:**
- Design doc path + `update` → Reformat to match current template

**User notes (optional):**
```
{{notes}}
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create design from feature spec
/dev-design docs/feature-spec.md

# Create design from notes only
/dev-design --notes "Add caching layer to reduce API calls"

# Update existing design doc to match current template
/dev-design docs/core-poc6-design.md update
```

**The command will:**
1. Read the guide and template
2. Analyze the input (or create from notes)
3. Structure using the template format
4. Write to `docs/[milestone-slug]-[task-slug]-design.md`

**Update mode** (when input is design doc + `update`):
1. Read the current template
2. Read the existing design doc
3. Restructure to match template (preserve content, update structure)
4. Write updated design doc

## Key Requirements

❌ **NO CODE** - This is design only (patterns/signatures OK, not implementations)

📋 **ANALYSIS** - Each item analyzed independently (numbered 1, 2, 3...)

🔗 **PROPOSED SEQUENCE** - Item order with rationale (#1 → #2 → #3)

🔒 **SELF-CONTAINED** - Task works independently, doesn't break existing functionality

## Process

Follow the guidance in `1-design-guide.md`:

1. Document current state vs target state
2. Identify and analyze each item independently (Analysis section)
3. Propose solution approach for each item
4. Define proposed sequence with rationale (Proposed Sequence section)
5. Document success criteria
6. Document risks and mitigations
7. Log design decisions

## Output

Create one document:
- `docs/[milestone-slug]-[task-slug]-design.md`

**Examples**: `docs/core-poc6-design.md`, `docs/cloud-auth-fix-design.md`

## After Completion

User will run `/verify-doc` on the design, fix issues, then request Stage 2 (Planning).
